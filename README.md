Password generator will give you certain prompts to ask for your preferences, once you had answered your preferences, it will automatically generate a random password for later use.
To get better results, make sure you refresh the page.
Some problems I had encountered during the process of it, was the fact that sometimes the request that is made by user is not taken for consideration, and it generates a random password with none of the choices that was requested.


Please find the demo gif and video in the folder "Demo" of my repo. also attached here
